## Simple Coffee Machine in JAVA

Exercise to practice Java.  This is from a Hyperskill task.

## Reflection

This was good revision.  The integrated approach of covering required theory and then doing a step of the task is great.  However, it leads to alot of redundant code that is unneeded for the finished task.  Starting with an overview of the final requirements such as a UML diagram then building would make more sense to me. 

It passed all the tests.
